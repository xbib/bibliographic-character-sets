Library of Congress
The Library of Congress provides an ANSEL code table file

https://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/codetables.xml

at https://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/specchartables.html for making the
character set implementation of ANSEL/Z39.47 possible, including east
asian code characters (EACC).

US-ASCII
The US-ASCII re-implementation was taken from the GNU classpath project.
It is provided as a demonstration of a simple single-byte character set.
