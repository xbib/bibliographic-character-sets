# Bibliographic character sets

This is a collection of bibliographic character sets implemented in 
Java.

These character sets have not been included in the standard Java 
distribution. Most of the character sets predate Unicode and are 
dormant now but are still in active use in library application 
system software.

The reason to provide these character sets is to assist the public 
in migrating library data to Unicode, and UTF-8, respectively.

## Usage

With Maven

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.xbib</groupId>
        <artifactId>bibliographic-character-sets</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

With Gradle

    configurations {
      provided
    }
    dependencies {
       provided 'org.xbib:bibliographic-character-sets:1.0.0'
    }

You can also include this jar in the classpath, the Java CharsetProvider and
ServiceLoader API will then make the character sets available, 
e.g. by `Charset.forName(name)`

This is free software. 
Please follow the AGPL license, which requires to offer the source code
